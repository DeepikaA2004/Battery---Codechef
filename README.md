## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Apple considers any iPhone with a battery health of 
80% or above, to be in optimal condition.
Given that your iPhone has 
X% battery health, find whether it is in optimal condition.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer 
X â€” the battery health.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the battery is in optimal condition, and NO otherwise.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, NO, no, No and nO, are all considered identical.

## Constraints
 1<=T<=100
 0<=X<=100

## Sample 1:
## Input               Output
    97                  YES
    42                  NO
    80                  YES
    10                  NO

## Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The battery health is 
97
%
97% which is greater than equal to 
80
%
80%. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.

Test case 
2
2: The battery health is 
42
%
42% which is less than 
80
%
80%. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.

Test case 
3
3: The battery health is 
80
%
80% which is greater than equal to 
80
%
80%. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.

Test case 
4
4: The battery health is 
10
%
10% which is less than 
80
%
80%. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.
